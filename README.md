# Paths

## Concept
Each journey is composed of nodes. Connecting the nodes will eventually form a path, and each path is a unique story.
I hope that through Paths, people can record the most beautiful and unique moments of the journey, and write down their own wonderful and memorable stories.

* Each journey is composed of nodes
* Users can only create nodes when they are at the physical location
* Each node can only contain one photo with few lines of comment.
* Node can't be edited after submitted.
* In the end of journey, each nodes will be connected, form a Path, and transfer to a uniqe story.
